    <h2>Why Rainwater Harvesting?</h2>
    <p>Discover the myriad benefits of collecting rainwater:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduce Water Bills:</strong> Significantly cut down on your municipal water consumption and save money.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainable Living:</strong> Lessen your environmental footprint and contribute to water conservation efforts.</li>
        <li><strong>Garden & Landscape Health:</strong> Provide your plants with natural, chemical-free water, leading to healthier growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Preparedness:</strong> Create an independent water source for times of drought or utility disruptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Stormwater Runoff:</strong> Help mitigate local flooding and erosion by capturing runoff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works (Simplified)</h2>
    <p>Rainwater harvesting is simpler than you think!</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Rain falls on your roof and flows into gutters.</li>
        <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> A basic filter removes leaves and debris.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The clean water is directed into a storage tank (cistern).</li>
        <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> The stored water can then be used for irrigation, toilet flushing, laundry, and even potable uses with proper purification.</li>
    </ol>
